🛸 Space Invaders: Nuclear Assault

Space Invaders: Nuclear Assault is a fast-paced, retro-inspired browser game built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Pilot a fighter jet to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders using bullets, missiles, and nukes. 
Featuring pixel-style sprites, explosive sound effects, and dynamic gameplay, this game brings arcade nostalgia to the modern browser.

No libraries, no frameworks—just pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Playable directly in the browser.
